# Chat-Management-System---CRUD-with-Node.js-Express-MongoDB-EJS
This Chat Management System is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS for CRUD operations. It uses method-override for PUT and DELETE requests and follows RESTful API principles. Chats are stored in MongoDB, and views are dynamically rendered with EJS, making it a great project to learn backend development.
